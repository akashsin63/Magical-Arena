# Magical Arena Game

The Magical Arena is a turn-based battle game where players engage in battles until one of them loses all their health. Each player has attributes such as health, strength, and attack, which determine their performance in battles. Players take turns attacking and defending using dice rolls to determine the outcome of each attack.

## Rules of the Game

### Player Attributes

Each player has three attributes:
- **Health**: Represents the player's remaining health points. A player dies when their health reaches 0.
- **Strength**: Represents the player's defensive capability. It reduces the damage taken during attacks.
- **Attack**: Represents the player's offensive capability. It determines the damage inflicted on the opponent during attacks.
